### The project

This is a template for a web3 blog. I implemented the basic functionality so that an admin user can connect using a specified web3 wallet.
The admin user can create blog posts and the data of the blog is saved into Grafbase and Cloudinary. The data is fetched via GraphQL queries from Grafbase.
