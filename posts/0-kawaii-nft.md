## Kawaii Warriors NFT

### Tools

* React => https://kawaiiwarriors.fun
* Solidity => Ethereum smart contract
* HTML/CSS
* Hashlips => Art generation
* Foundry

### The project


This is an ethereum project that I built to learn more about building an ERC721 token, and my first time trying out React.
The supply of this project is 5000.
I generated the art with various layers created in Photoshop and combining them with Hashlips.
The smart contract inherits from the standard erc721a token functionality, and implemented a mint function that let users generate one free token and up to 10 per transaction for a cost.
I deployed the art to ipfs using NFTUp and tested my contract with Foundry.
I deployed the smart contract to testnet and mainnet with Foundry.
I converted my CSS/Html/JS website to a React app.
