## Ecommerce Template

### Tools

* NextJS => https://r-ecom-store.vercel.app/
* https://github.com/cdavidr1/r_ecom_store
* Stripe
* Sanity

### The project


This is a basic template for selling products online. My motivation for this project was so that I could understand what the process of integration is like with an ecommerce system like Stripe and to create a barebones template with the basic functionality of an ecommerce store. 
In order to manage the inventory of the store, sanity studio was integrated as well, and the application uses Next's file-based routing, server-side rendering and static generation.
